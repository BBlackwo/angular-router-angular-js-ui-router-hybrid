# Conclusion

As you can see, it's not a staightforward task to implement this hybrid routing, but we found it worth it. We've now upgraded a large chunk of our apps to Angular and this was made possible by using Angular Upgrade and incrementally updating as we worked on various parts of the apps.

I hope this has been helpful. If you have any other tips or experiences please let me know. If you have any issues please raise an [issue](https://github.com/BBlackwo/angular-router-angular-js-ui-router-hybrid/issues) on the GitHub repo or feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/BBlackwo/angular-router-angular-js-ui-router-hybrid/pulls).
